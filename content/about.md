Howdy, I'm Mirza! Passionate web developer. Both front end and back end are my primary interest. I'm all about turning observations into visual storytelling, and having fun in the process of problem solving.

The very first website I made was a static site for school project built with HTML and CSS only. It had a marquee tag and Notepad++ was a thing that day. Later, I discovered Adobe Dreamweaver. And then come along the Javascript, PHP.

When I'm not doing my code, I enjoy watching anime, TV-series, K-drama, and listening to podcast.

This website is built using NuxtJS and TailwindCSS. Hosted on Netlify, an all-in-one platform that makes hosting static websites as well as other modern web projects incredibly easy.
